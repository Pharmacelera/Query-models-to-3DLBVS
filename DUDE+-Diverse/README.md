# Query-models-to-3DLBVS

An ECPF4 filtered version of the DUD-E+ dataset used in VS benchmarking is available. Each target folder contains a set of actives molecules structurally diverse to a reference/known active compound and the corresponding decoys for that target. All molecules are in SMILES string format. These sets are ideal to test the strength of LBVS methods that use representations beyond the 2D topological descriptors.
